        <h3>She Codes Plus 2020</h3>
        <p>She Codes Plus is an intensive teaching technical skills. The program covers HTML/CSS, Python, Django, Cloud Deployment, Git, React js and much more. information is availble on the <a href="https://shecodes.com.au/plus/">She Codes</a> website.</p>

            <p>You're looking at it! Built using HTML & CSS, the Portfolio Page was our first project in the plus program.<br> Having only worked with "old-fashioned" HTML, I enjoyed playing with CSS, and challenged myself to add a javascript hamburger, and I was a little too proud of the hamburger menu icon.</p>

            <p>Deployed locally, I enjoyed getting back to being creative with my first Django Project. I enjoyed creating something for a user, and played with getting the Django Admin Center user friendly. Once the minimum requirements for this project were meant, I knew I needed to add some ads to the page before submitting, just like any other news source.</p>

            <img src ="images/mobile_development.svg" alt = "web-app">
            <p>Only Cats has been created as a fun take on a Crowdfunding app. The site adds the functionality of showing/hiding/obstructiving images depending on whether or not a member has backed a "project" and if the goal has been met. The Django Rest Frame Work is deployed on <a href ="https://afternoon-caverns-51544.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>, as is the React font end.</p>

            <p>Our group of four were tasked with creating a front and back end of a website for prospective mentors to find out about events happening near them. We had four weeks to deliver this project, with my primary focus on creating the data model, managing source control, deploymnent and documentation for the group to refer to. Again, everything has been deployed to Heroku and the <a href="http://binary-api.herokuapp.com/">API</a> is also available.</p>
